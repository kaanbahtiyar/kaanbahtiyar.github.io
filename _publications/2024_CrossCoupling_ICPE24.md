Peer-reviewed conference paper based on the [axis-coupled inertial vibration compensation using machine tool feed drives project](/projects/cross-coupling-vibrations/).

**Abstract.**  
Apart from the process-induced forced and chatter, most high-speed machine tools suffer from inertial forced vibrations, which are triggered during rapid acceleration of the machine axes. Particularly, vertical machining centers suffer from axis-coupling type inertial forced vibrations, which occur when the X/Y axes accelerate and trigger rocking motion of the machine column causing the Z-axis to tip/tilt. This unwanted vertical Z-axis motion destroys the surface finish. This paper presents a novel compensation scheme augmented with a data-based tuning strategy to enable the machine to eliminate such unwanted vibrations. A trajectory pre-filter is designed, which commands the Z-axis to retract the tool based on the expected X/Y axis coupled vibration. The pre-filter coefficients are tuned iteratively based on the measured vibration data. Experimental results show that the coupled Z-axis vibration can be lowered by ~80% while allowing shorter cartesian axis acceleration time constants for greater productivity.
