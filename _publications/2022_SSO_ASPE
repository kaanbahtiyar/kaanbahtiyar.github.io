**Extended abstract (summary).**  
This work introduces a model-free spindle speed optimization strategy for milling aimed at minimizing the overall vibration level, including both forced and chatter components. Instead of relying on process models and stability lobe diagrams, the method uses extremum seeking control (ESC) to adaptively regulate spindle speed based on in-process vibration measurements. A vibration-variance–based cost function is defined to penalize total vibration energy. The ESC algorithm perturbs the spindle speed, estimates the gradient of the cost with respect to speed, and updates the spindle speed via gradient descent to seek the minimum of this cost. The approach allows selection of spindle speed that simultaneously avoids chatter and reduces forced vibrations, improving surface finish without requiring modal testing or detailed cutting dynamics models.
