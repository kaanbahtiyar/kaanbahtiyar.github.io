**Extended abstract (summary).**  
Vibration dampers such as tuned mass dampers (TMDs) or semi- and fully-active inertial damper systems are widely used in ultra-precision machine tools for vibration mitigation. They are effective at damping resonances, and improving the steady state response of the equipment against forced vibrations. However, damper systems are typically not highly effective at significantly improving the transient response of the structure. This paper presents a novel application of Iterative Learning Control (ILC) to dramatically enhance the performance of inertial damper systems for transient vibration suppression in ultra-precision machine tools (UPMs). The proposed active damper control strategy iteratively generates a pre-scheduled optimal feedforward compensation signal for the inertial actuator so that the damper can timely counteract and hence fully eliminate the transient vibrations experienced by the equipment. Numerical and experimental results validate the approach demonstrating a significant reduction in peak vibration while using equal or less actuator force as compared to the conventional control.
