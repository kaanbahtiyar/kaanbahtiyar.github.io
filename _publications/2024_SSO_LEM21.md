**Abstract.**  
This paper presents a spindle speed control strategy for minimizing overall machining vibrations to improve surface finish quality in milling operations. The strategy is designed within an extremum seeking control (ESC) framework, where the control algorithm monitors machining vibrations and regulates spindle speed in real time to reduce them. The cost function, penalizing combined forced and chatter vibrations, is defined as a moving average of the vibration variance measured via an accelerometer. The proposed algorithm perturbs the process by introducing a spindle speed variation and observes the response. The cost-function gradient is computed in a data-driven manner using least-squares (LS) filtering, and the new spindle speed is updated via a gradient-descent law to minimize the cost. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm and its superior performance in reducing vibration levels while stabilizing the process compared to a conventional spindle speed regulation technique.
