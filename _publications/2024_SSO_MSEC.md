**Abstract.**  
This paper presents novel adaptive spindle speed control strategies to minimize machining vibrations. Machining processes suffer from forced and chatter vibrations that deteriorate surface finish, reduce tool life, and can damage machine components. Model-based process planning strategies are commonly used to minimize the effect of these unwanted vibrations, typically requiring modal (tap) testing and development of machining process models to determine forced vibration levels and to generate stability lobe diagrams for chatter-free cutting conditions. Although effective, these model-guided strategies face key bottlenecks: (1) they require expert knowledge that is not widely available in small-to-medium-sized enterprises and (2) their effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the employed models. As a result, many machining industries still rely on know-how-based process planning to mitigate vibrations. This paper proposes practical and model-free self-optimizing (adaptive) spindle-speed regulation strategies that minimize machining vibrations through in-situ vibration (acceleration) measurements. Two approaches are presented to mitigate both forced and chatter vibrations by monitoring acceleration levels during machining. Strategy I utilizes a dither signal to determine the spindle speed that minimizes overall machining vibrations, whereas Strategy II is a dither-free approach that employs least-squares fitting to seek the optimal spindle speed. Both approaches can determine chatter-free cutting conditions and also reduce forced vibration levels for improved surface finish. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.
