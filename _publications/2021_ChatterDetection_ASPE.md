**Extended abstract (summary).**  
This work proposes a time-domain methodology for early detection of chatter vibrations in milling. First, cutting-related stable vibrations are extracted from the measured vibration signal using a Kalman filter that adaptively tracks the spindle-frequency components and their harmonics. The cutting vibration component is then subtracted from the original signal to obtain a residual in which the chatter components remain. The energies of the separated vibration components are calculated from their variances, and an energy-ratio metric comparing cutting and chatter energy is used, with a 50% threshold to declare chatter onset. Experiments on recorded vibration signals show that the approach can identify the onset of chatter quickly and accurately, enabling earlier process-parameter adjustments than conventional frequency-domain techniques.
