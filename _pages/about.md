I am a PhD researcher specializing in control systems and mechatronics for manufacturing equipment. My work integrates first-principles modeling with data-driven methods to design, analyze, and control high-performance mechatronic systems and advanced manufacturing processes. I have hands-on experience developing real-time control and optimization strategies, system identification methods, and vibration mitigation techniques to enhance the accuracy and dynamic performance of machine tools and motion delivery systems. My research aims to apply modern control and optimization approaches and translate rigorous theory into practical, experimentally validated solutions.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on advanced manufacturing systems, particularly in precision motion control, machining process control, and real-time vibration suppression. My MS work concentrated on vibration mitigation in milling, while my PhD research centers on precision motion control and active damping of high-performance motion delivery systems.
