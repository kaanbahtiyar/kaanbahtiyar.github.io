I am a detail-oriented control systems engineer specializing in precision motion control, mechatronics, machining dynamics, and real-time vibration mitigation for advanced manufacturing equipment. My work integrates first-principles modeling with data-driven methods to design and control high-performance mechatronic systems. I have hands-on experience in real-time control and optimization, system identification, and vibration mitigation to improve the accuracy and dynamic performance of machine tools and motion delivery systems. My goal is to translate rigorous modern control and optimization theory into practical, experimentally validated solutions for industrial manufacturing.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on advanced manufacturing systems, particularly in precision motion control, machining process control, and real-time vibration suppression. My MS work concentrated on vibration mitigation in milling, while my PhD research centers on precision motion control and active damping of high-performance motion delivery systems.

* Machining process control
