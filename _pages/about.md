I am a detail-oriented control systems engineer specializing in precision motion control, mechatronics, and machining process dynamics and control for advanced manufacturing applications. My work integrates first-principles modeling with data-driven methods to design and control high-performance mechatronic systems. I have hands-on experience in real-time control and optimization, system identification, and vibration mitigation to improve the accuracy and dynamic performance of machine tools and motion delivery systems. My goal is to translate rigorous modern control and optimization theory into practical, experimentally validated solutions for industrial manufacturing and intelligent automation.

Research Interests
======

My research focuses on advanced manufacturing systems and intelligent automation, with emphasis on precision motion control, machining process control, and real-time vibration suppression. 

* Precision motion control for high-performance stages and machine tools  
* Real-time vibration mitigation and active damping in mechatronic systems  
* Machining process monitoring, optimization, and control  
* System identification and physics-based/data-driven modeling for machining processes, manufacturing systems, and motion platforms
* Intelligent manufacturing automation and equipment-level control architectures
